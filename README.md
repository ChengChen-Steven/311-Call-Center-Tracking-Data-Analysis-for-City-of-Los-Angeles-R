# 311-Call-Center-Tracking-Data-Analysis-for-City-of-Los-Angeles-

The city of Los Angeles would like to get analysis for the 311 call center tracking data. This project is a group work which intends to help the city of Los Angeles to analyze 311 call data in a more efficient way.

This repo is the project of MyLA311, aiming to help MyLA311 to better solve the requests submitted by LA residents. With the effort, we hope to help Council District Members and MyLA311 to detect the problems and adjust resources in time.

### 1. Exploring data

The exploredata_1.R ,exploredata_2.R and exploredata_3.R give plots that help us to start visualizing the dataset at the very beginning.

Then we have leaflet.R, Tab1Shinylocal.R and Tab2Shinylocal.R files which include the code to help establish our shiny, which is our main focus.

### 2. Shiny

Since we are helping 311 to solve problems, so we think it will be a good idea to create a product that could further developed by their technicians and easy to deployed at 311 to improve the quality and efficiency of its services that delivered to citizens.
